Welcome to Subspireâ„¢
==================================================

Project Introduction
------
Subspire is a Subscriptions Management Dashboard along with customized notifications from all kinds of services at one platform. It is hard for any normal individual user to keep track of their subscriptions or memberships and often forget that they are subscribed and being charged. So, we came up with a simple yet powerful solution of building a one-stop dashboard along with Search Analytics.
